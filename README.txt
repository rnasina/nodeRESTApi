To see something, you need to follow these steps:

-Make sure you have a mongo server up and running. Download the latest mongo version
 -Run mongod.exe prior to starting your mongo.exe
-Install the latest version of node(nothing less than v3.6)
-Run "npm start" to see the server started and connected to the mongo instance

-To check the APIs you can install postman and check the API calls like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
